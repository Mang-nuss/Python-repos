A small directory of Python exercise files. So far, it includes:
1. Magic square. Description:
  'A n*n square of the numbers 1,2,3...n^2 is built up. The square is told to be 'magic'
  if all rows, columns and diagonals add up to the same number. For instance,
  the following:
  -----------
  16,3,2,13,
  5,10,11,8,
  9,6,7,12,
  4,15,14,1
  -----------
  is magic, for n = 4. If you switch e.g. the numbers 2 <-> 3, the two middle columns are flawed.

  This program is to take a number sequence s (by user input or randomising function) of size n*n
  as input. Thereafter, it will check whether s forms a magic square.'
